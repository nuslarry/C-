***別在c++用malloc,沒call constructor, 型態不安全

***Calling Constructors: new calls constructors, while malloc() does not. In fact primitive data types 
(char, int, float.. etc) can also be initialized with new. For example, below program prints 10.

#include<iostream> 
  
using namespace std; 
  
int main() 
{ 
   int *n = new int(10); // initialization with new() 
   cout << *n; 
   return 0; 
} 

Differences:

1. operator vs function: new is an operator, while malloc() is a function.
2. return type: new returns exact data type, while malloc() returns void *.
3. Failure Condition: On failure, malloc() returns NULL where as new Throws.

4. Memory: In case of new, memory is allocated from free store where as in malloc() memory allocation is done from heap.
   free store vs heap (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-purpose-of-the-free-store-in-C)
   簡雃言之, 就是沒差別,compiler會處理這個事情
   
5. Overriding: We are allowed to override new operator where as we can not override the malloc() function legally.
6. Size: Required size of memory is calculated by compiler for new, where as we have to manually calculate size for malloc().
